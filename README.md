# Synthetic Biology Papers Reading Roadmap

>If you are a newcomer to the field of Synthetic Biology area, the first question you may have is "Which paper should I start reading from?"

>Here is a reading roadmap of Synthetic Biology papers!

The roadmap is constructed in accordance with the following four guidelines:

- From outline to detail
- From old to state-of-the-art
- from generic to specific areas
- focus on state-of-the-art

You will find many papers that are quite new but really worth reading.

I would continue adding papers to this roadmap.
