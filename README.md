# Synthetic Biology Papers Reading Roadmap

>If you are a newcomer to the field of Synthetic Biology area, the first question you may have is "Which paper should I start reading from?"

>Here is a reading roadmap of Synthetic Biology papers!

The roadmap is constructed in accordance with the following four guidelines:

- From outline to detail
- From old to state-of-the-art
- from generic to specific areas
- focus on state-of-the-art

You will find many papers that are quite new but really worth reading.

This list is curated by the Harvard BioDesign Team.  Please contact us at crimsonigem at gmail dot com for comments and updates!
